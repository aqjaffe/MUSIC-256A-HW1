# MUSIC-256A-HW1
This program is a simple Keyboard Piano, which uses the keyboard's shape and layout to emulate that of a piano.
For example the 'a' key maps to the note C5, 'w' maps to C#5, 's' maps to D5, etc.

There is one remaining bug in the code which is that the keyboard listeners do not work until the user has clicked one of the toggle buttons at least one time beforehand. Then, everything works as desired.

Created for HW1 of MUSIC 256A at Stanford, created using JUCE.
